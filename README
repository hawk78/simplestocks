This directory contains the solution itself in simplestock.py
and an example/demo file in test.py

The code is written in order to be efficient and readable according 
to my interpretation of the execrcise description.

All computations are done at transaction insert time, but they could be
just started at insert time and recollected (in a dataflow style) at a
later time.

The code tries to be side effects free and testable. Simplicity is the 
overall goal but also decent performances and correct results (up to my
understanding of trading and the description).
